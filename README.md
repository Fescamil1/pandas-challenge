# pandas-challenge
Use Python Pandas and apply it to PyCitySchools data challenge using Jupyter Notebook 

Challenge goal is to : Analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Data for every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend is provided in two csv files. The script should aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### **Observations** 

* Charter schools seem to have performed better than the district schools on all metrics. The difference was more significant when comparing the percentage of students passing Math.  

* Contrary to what was expected, the schools with larger budgets did not outperform schools with lower budgets. The top performing schools had significantly smaller budgets. However, the top performing schools also had less students than the bottom performing schools. One should analyze if student to teacher ratio had a significant impact in the students performance.
